# Logic App 01 – Tamper Trigger Parameter

## 📝 Scenario
Some developers leave sensitive parameters that reveal sensitive data.  
Your task: find the parameter in the URL and obtain the flag.

## 📖 Overview

### What is a Logic App?
Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows us to create and run automated workflows and integrate various applications, systems, and services.

### What is a Requests Trigger?
In Azure Logic Apps, the **Requests trigger** is a commonly used trigger that initiates a workflow whenever an HTTP request is received.

### What is IDOR?
**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.  
Attackers can manipulate inputs (like URLs or parameters) to gain unauthorized access to data.

💡 *Hint: IDORs are common web application vulnerabilities.*

## 🔓 Exploitation

1. Copy the trigger URL provided and paste it into the browser.  
2. Observe the response — a text message appears.  
3. Notice the `{name}` parameter in the URL. This looks interesting.  
4. Enumerate by changing the parameter value.  
   - Example: Change `{name}` to `admin`.  
5. After sending the request with `name=admin`, the response reveals a **flag**.

## ⚠️ Impact
The Logic App using a request trigger with parameters was vulnerable to **IDOR**.  
When triggered with the `"admin"` parameter, the Logic App revealed sensitive data.
