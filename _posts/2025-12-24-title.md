## 📖 Overview

### What is a Logic App?
Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows us to create and run automated workflows and integrate various applications, systems, and services.

### What is a Requests Trigger?
In Azure Logic Apps, the **Requests trigger** is a commonly used trigger that initiates a workflow whenever an HTTP request is received.

### What is IDOR?
**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.  
Attackers can manipulate inputs (like URLs or parameters) to gain unauthorized access to data.

💡 *Hint: IDORs are common web application vulnerabilities.*

Get the URL from Labs 

https://prod-02.australiaeast.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/63354b4495864bd1ba59754428efbaec/triggers/manual/paths/invoke/{name}?api-version=2018-07-01-preview&sp=%2Ftriggers%2Fmanual%2Frun&sv=1.0&sig=okpbUCVPyrzJNuSNj77O92oMPl0NBbV0ezhfwC8rmqE  

Then Run it on Any browser you will have below response

You'll have to change the parameter Name to Admin as mentione on Labs, 

Open Burp suit And go to decoder section then put the URL

Lab solved 

## 🔓 Exploitation

1. Copy the trigger URL provided and paste it into the browser.  
2. Observe the response — a text message appears.  
3. Notice the `{name}` parameter in the URL. This looks interesting.  
4. Enumerate by changing the parameter value.  
   - Example: Change `{name}` to `admin`.  
5. After sending the request with `name=admin`, the response reveals a **flag**.

---

## ⚠️ Impact
The Logic App using a request trigger with parameters was vulnerable to **IDOR**.  
When triggered with the `"admin"` parameter, the Logic App revealed sensitive data.
