# Logic App 02 – Tamper Trigger Parameter and Request

## 🧩 Scenario
Some developers leave sensitive parameters exposed in URLs, which can lead to data leakage. This challenge demonstrates parameter tampering and explores multiple request methods to exploit a Logic App trigger and retrieve a flag.

---

## 📘 Overview

### What is a Logic App?
Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based service by Microsoft Azure that enables users to create and run automated workflows integrating various applications, systems, and services.

### What is a Requests Trigger?
In Azure Logic Apps, the "Requests" trigger initiates a workflow whenever an HTTP request is received. It’s commonly used to expose endpoints for automation.

### What is IDOR?
IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) is a vulnerability where an application exposes internal objects based on user-supplied input. Attackers can manipulate parameters (e.g., in URLs or forms) to access unauthorized data.

---

## 🧠 Hint
- IDORs are common in web applications.
- HTTP requests support multiple methods (GET, POST, etc.).

### 🔍 Exploitation Steps

1. **Copy the Trigger URL**  
   Open the provided Logic App trigger URL in a browser.

2. **Initial Response**  
   A text message appears. Inspect the URL and notice a parameter like `{name}`.

3. **Parameter Enumeration**  
   Replace `{name}` with `admin` and resend the request.

4. **Error Message**  
   The browser returns an error indicating that a POST method is expected.

5. **Send POST Request via cURL**  
   Use the following command to send a POST request:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://<logic-app-url>?name=admin" -d ""

6. ✅ **Flag:** "asowaikc780asvwiamo780"
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

The response contains a different message with the final flag.

⚠️ Impact

This Logic App exposed an IDOR vulnerability via its request trigger. By tampering with the name parameter and switching to a POST method, sensitive data (the flag) was revealed.
